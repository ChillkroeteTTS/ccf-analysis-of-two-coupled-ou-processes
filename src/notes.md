### ACF with different initial conditions

**What I saw in the measurements:**
With IC(initial condition) set to 0 (the mean of the process), the ACF of the OU process seems to be same as the one of the noise (should be checked in a graph),
this is probably, because the "relaxation force" is too weak as long as the process is close to it's mean.
