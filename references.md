>> The original aim of the Fokker-Planck and Langevin equations is to describe the Brownian motion.But in general, they could also explain the behavior of a system in presence of a random noiseand its evolution toward a stationary state. Therefore, they could also be applied to thermalizationprocesses of non-equilibrium systems.**In  this  report  we  will  introduce  these  equations,  demonstrate  the  analytical  solutions  to  somesimple examples, present some solution methods and show some modern developments of themat the end.**
